    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>This is my website for Homework 3. You will find tabs along the navigation bar for each table in my database. The instructor table is interactive.</p>
    <p>There is a hyperlink associated with the instructor name, this redirects you to the instructor and course tables joined.</p>
    <p>If you click the Instructor button on the courses page it will take you to a joined record showing who instructs the course. This is done with a post variable.</p>
